	<li>Increased the performance of <code>index.php</code> and <code>forumdisplay.php</code> by adding <code>postcount</code> and <code>threadcount</code> fields to the <code>board</code> table.

	<li>Disabled HTML errors.</li>
	<li>Many minor bug fixes</li>
	<li>Tons of minor markup &amp; CSS cleanup and fixes</li>
	<li>Tons of minor code cleanup</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that made it impossible to add new avatars.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the deletion of attachments.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that prevented post icons from being removed.</li>

	<li>Minor markup cleanup</li>
	<li>Lots of minor code consolidation and cleanup</li>
	<li>The long-awaited Admin Control Panel makes its debut, comprised of several components:
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li>Main source file, <code>admincp.php</code></li>
			<li>New directory, <code>/includes/admincp</code>, which stores the dependencies of <code>admincp.php</code>:
				<ul class="sublist">
					<li><code>addavatar.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>addforum.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>addposticon.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>addsmilie.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>addusergroup.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>addusergroupuser.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>avatars.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>editavatar.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>editforum.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>editposticon.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>editsmilie.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>editusergroup.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>forums.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>general.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>posticons.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>removeavatar.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>removeforum.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>removeposticon.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>removesmilie.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>removeusergroup.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>smilies.inc.php</code></li>

					<li><code>usergroups.inc.php</code></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Added a new database table, <code>configuration</code>, which replaces the functionality of these files:
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li><code>avatars.inc.php</code></li>
			<li><code>censored.inc.php</code></li>
			<li><code>config.inc.php</code></li>
			<li><code>posticons.inc.php</code></li>
			<li><code>smilies.inc.php</code></li>
			<li><code>usergroups.inc.php</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Because of the previous change, all standard pages will consume an extra database query and about 0.005 seconds more of generation time; however, updating the forum configuration is now trivial and no longer requires PHP to have write permissions.</li>
	<li>Changed the defaults of several <code>member</code> fields from <code>NULL</code> to realistic values.</li>
	<li>Changed the data type of the <code>threadview</code> field in the <code>member</code> table from <code>tinyint(2)</code> to <code>smallint(4)</code>, since 1000 is the largest value it would hold.</li>
	<li>Removed the <code>customavatar</code> field in the <code>member</code> table (again?!), as it isn't used anymore.</li>
	<li>Removed the fulltext search key in the <code>post</code> table, as it was never used.</li>
	<li>The <code>timestamp</code> field in the <code>avatar</code> table is now unsigned.</li>
	<li>Added a new configuration setting, <code>$CFG['bufferoutput']</code>, which determines whether or not page output is buffered before it's sent to the client.</li>
	<li>Added a new configuration setting, <code>$CFG['paths']['posticons']</code>, which specifies the file path of the installed post icons.</li>
	<li>Post icons now have their own directory, by default, and no longer contain an underscore in their filenames.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that prevented users from updating their avatar (unless they typed in the editavatar URI).</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that caused the &quot;Disable Smilies&quot; setting to not be observed when saving a copy of a sent message.</li>
	<li>The stylesheet, <code>style.inc.php</code>, now observes the active, hover, and visited anchor property settings.</li>
	<li>The database connection information will remain in a separate file, but is no longer created/updated by the Setup script; the administrator must do this when installing/upgrading.</li>
	<li>The CAPTCHA image, <code>regimage.php</code>, now initializes OvBB like everything else.</li>
	<li>Fixed some potential XSS vulnerabilities.</li>
	<li>Lots of minor markup cleanup/fixes</li>
	<li>Lots of minor cleanup/changes and bug fixes</li>
	<li>The system is now distributed under the terms of the MIT License</li>
	<li>Added some moderator features via <code>mod.php</code>:
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li>Open/Close Threads</li>
			<li>Stick/Unstick Threads</li>
			<li>Delete Thread/Posts</li>
			<li>Move / Copy Thread</li>
			<li>Get IP</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>As a result of the aforementioned new feature, the &quot;IP: Logged&quot; link (displayed with posts and PMs) now works</li>
	<li>Added a rudimentary setup script for installing or upgrading</li>
	<li>Categories are now searchable</li>
	<li>Implemented the <code>finduser</code>, <code>getnew</code>, and <code>getdaily</code> routines in <code>search.php</code>; only thing left to do in the Search engine is to implement logical operators</li>
	<li>The existing user option, <code>threadview</code>, is now implemented and is actually observed by <code>forumdisplay.php</code></li>
	<li>The &quot;View New Posts&quot; and &quot;View Today's Active Threads&quot; links at the top of the forum index now work</li>
	<li>Added &quot;Forum Jump&quot; and &quot;Search this forum&quot; forms to <code>forumdisplay.php</code></li>
	<li>Added a new forum configuration setting, <code>$CFG['iplogging']</code>, which determines whether or not user IP addresses should be logged</li>
	<li>Added two new usergroup permissions, <code>cmdeletethreads</code> and <code>cmstickythreads</code>, which are used in the new moderation routines</li>
	<li>Added two new images, <code>user_search.png</code> and <code>user_buddy.png</code>, which are displayed as links under user messages</li>
	<li>Added new image, <code>newreply_closed.png</code>, which is used in replace of <code>newreply.png</code> when a thread is closed</li>
	<li>Added a new field, <code>timestamp</code>, to the <code>avatar</code> table of the database, which stores the avatar's last modification time preventing it from being downloaded more than once unnecessarily</li>
	<li>Added a new field, <code>type</code>, to the <code>avatar</code> table of the database; since the image type is now stored in the avatar's record, determining the type is no longer based on the filename extension</li>
	<li>Added a new field, <code>lpost</code>, to the <code>thread</code> table of the database, which stores the last post date of threads, allowing the <code>threadview</code> user option to be implemented</li>

	<li>Improved the functionality of <code>editpost.php</code>:
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li>The user is redirected to their post, now taking into account which page it's on</li>
			<li>Users' postcounts are now updated accurately when the entire thread is deleted</li>
			<li>The poll (if the thread contains one) is removed when the entire thread is deleted</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The &quot;Find more posts by user&quot; links in threads, private messages, and member profiles now correctly uses the new <code>finduser</code> search routine instead of <code>query->usersearch</code></li>
	<li>If the page requested in <code>forumdisplay.php</code>, <code>memberlist.php</code>, <code>search.php</code>, or <code>thread.php</code> is out of range, it is now defaulted to the last available page</li>
	<li>Rewrote the "Jump to folder" feature used throughout the Private Messaging System to work when JavaScript is disabled or unsupported</li>
	<li>Rewrote the "Forum Jump" forms located throughout the forums to work when JavaScript is disabled or unsupported</li>
	<li>The error handler again observes <code>error_reporting()</code>, just in case a function is silenced with the <code>@</code> operator</li>
	<li><code>Msg()</code> now displays a CSS-based message, instead of the table-based one it previously used</li>

	<li>Fixed a bug that prevented users from picking a post icon with an ID greater than 14</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that prevented users with cookies disabled from properly being meta-redirected</li>
	<li>Fixed the so-called &quot;double-tag&quot; bug in <code>ParseEMails()</code> which caused addresses already enclosed in tags to be double-tagged</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in <code>newreply.php</code>, <code>newthread.php</code>, and <code>editpost.php</code> that caused a user's posted information to be lost when it contained errors, requiring them to re-enter everything</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in <code>search.php</code> that caused results to be displayed in the reverse sort order when viewing as posts</li>
	<li>Fixed and updated several location descriptions in <code>online.php</code></li>

	<li>The <code>ipaddress</code> field in the <code>pm</code> and <code>searchresult</code> tables is no longer unsigned so that it can store all values returned from PHP's <code>ip2long()</code> function</li>
	<li>The <code>ipaddress</code> field in the <code>searchresult</code> table can now store <code>NULL</code> as a value (like the rest of the <code>ipaddress</code> fields), in case IP logging is disabled</li>
	<li>The <code>type</code> field in the <code>board</code> table has been renamed to <code>level</code>, its datatype changed to <code>tinyint(3)</code>, and can no longer be of type NULL; this is in preparation of introducing multi-level forums (i.e. subforums)</li>
	<li>The <code>customavatar</code> field in the <code>member</code> table has been eliminated since it's no longer used</li>
	<li>For maximum compatibility and consistency, the maximum length of several "varchar"-type fields in the database has increased to 255 characters:
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li>attachment.filename</li>
			<li>board.name</li>
			<li>board.description</li>

	<li>Cleaned up lots of messages for consistency and clarity</li>
	<li>Minor bug fixes</li>
	<li>Minor CSS and markup fixes</li>
	<li>90% feature-complete, the Search engine has been rewritten and is comprised of several components:
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li>Main source file, <code>search.php</code></li>
			<li>Common words file, <code>/includes/commonwords.inc.php</code></li>
			<li>New directory, <code>/includes/search</code>, which stores the dependencies of <code>search.php</code>:
				<ul class="sublist">
					<li><code>main.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>threadresults.inc.php</code></li>
					<li><code>postresults.inc.php</code></li>

	<li>Fixed (I think) a bug in the time-related functionality; apparently I had removed a configuration setting I thought was no longer needed:
		<ul class="sublist">
			<li><code>$CFG['time_offset']['display']</code> renamed to <code>$CFG['time']['display_offset']</code></li>
    		<li><code>$CFG['time']['dst_offset']</code> configuration setting re-added; previously existed as <code>$CFG['dst']</code></li>
    		<li><code>$CFG['time']['dst']</code> configuration setting added to replace using <code>date('I')</code></li>
    		<li><code>$CFG['time_offset']['server']</code> configuration setting deleted</li>
    		<li>Unnecessary (I hope) else clause removed from <code>init.inc.php</code></li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added a location description for <code>event.php</code> in <code>online.php</code>; the absence of a description caused users who were viewing a calendar event to have an empty Last Activity value in the <i>Who's Online</i> list</li>
	<li>Capitalized &quot;index&quot; in the location description for <code>index.php</code> in <code>online.php</code></li>

	<li>The &quot;Disable smilies...&quot; option in <code>newreply.php</code> and <code>addevent.php</code> actually works now</li>
	<li>Posts that have smilies disabled in them are now displayed correctly by <code>thread.php</code></li>
	<li>The automatic e-mail address parsing option in <code>newthread.php</code>, <code>newreply.php</code>, and <code>addevent.php</code> now works; the one in <code>editpost.php</code> will work, too, when I fix the double-tag bug in <code>ParseEMails()</code></li>
	<li>Disabled the automatic e-mail address parsing option in <code>editpost.php</code> until I fix a bug (see above)</li>
	<li>Disabled the automatic URL parsing option in <code>newthread.php</code> and <code>newreply.php</code>, as that functionality hasn't been added yet</li>
	<li>New source file added, <code>functions.inc.php</code>, whose purpose is to consolidate the many functions into one location; though only two functions are in it as of now, most--if not all--will be there in the coming versions</li>
	<li>New functions added: <code>ParseMessage()</code> and <code>ParseEMails()</code></li>
	<li>Improved the parsing of these vB formatting codes: [b], [i], and [u]</li>
	<li>vB formatting codes added: [email], [email=<i>blah</i>], [url], and [url=<i>blah</i>]</li>
	<li>New source file added, <code>forgotdetails.php</code>, which allows users to retrieve their member details in case they've forgotten them; also fixed an associated link in <code>editpost.php</code></li>
	<li>New database table added, <code>request</code>, which temporarily stores member details requests</li>
	<li>Almost all static forum colors have been replaced with configuration settings definable in <code>config.inc.php</code>; changing the forum color layout is now as simple as updating the configuration file!</li>
	<li>The <i>View New Posts</i> link that appears at the top of the forum index when you're logged in no longer points to the non-existent <code>somelink.php</code> page; the <i>View New Posts</i> functionality still doesn't work, mind you, but at least it doesn't take you to a non-existent page</li>
	<li>Added the item, <i>Please select one:</i>, into the Forum Jump list found in various places throughout the forums; the absence of this caused the first forum listed to be inaccessible</li>
	<li>Improved the &quot;vBulletin-likeness&quot; of the style of <code>memberlist.php</code></li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that caused dates to be incorrectly formatted in <code>addevent.php</code></li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in <code>addevent.php</code> that allowed users to post events without subjects</li>
	<li>Added a space to fix a grammatically-incorrect error message in <code>addevent.php</code></li>
	<li>Changed all occurrences of &quot;date&quot; to &quot;day&quot;, in <code>addevent.php</code>, when referencing a day and not a complete date</li>
	<li>Removed the &quot;Make this event public?&quot; option in <code>addevent.php</code>, as it was giving me headaches and isn't necessary anyway; I'll probably add it back at a later version</li>
	<li>Replaced most of the remaining vBulletin images with my own</li>
	<li>Renamed several images for better description</li>
	<li>Converted all remaining GIF images to PNG</li>
	<li>Removed unneeded background image instance in <code>header.php</code></li>
	<li>Fixed a fatal bug in the results page of <code>search.php</code></li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in <code>editpost.php</code> that would've allowed anyone to edit any post</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in <code>newreply.php</code> that caused new replies to be only partially added to the database</li>
	<li>Got rid of various benign warnings that showed up in <code>editpost.php</code>, <code>index.php</code>, and <code>register.php</code></li>
	<li>Corrected the text style of the message boxes in <code>newreply.php</code> and <code>newthread.php</code></li>
	<li>Modified <code>index.php</code> so that it only displays the Board Statistics and newest member welcome when there actually exists at least one registered member</li>
</ul>
