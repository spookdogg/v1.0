<h1>V0.16a</h1>

<p>Welcome to the 16<sup>th</sup> release of OvBB, the open source discussion board system that aims to mimic vBulletin 2.x.x in both look and behavior while incorporating new features and functionality. This release fixes a handful of bugs, changes some behavior, and adds some new features, however the most important difference is the addition of PostgreSQL support and the ability to easily add support for more databases in later versions. As always, check out <span class="file">changelog.html</span> for details on exactly what has changed since V0.15a.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Although OvBB works on most setups, you should make sure your environment fulfills these requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>About 1.5 megabytes of free storage space</li>
	<li>PHP 4.3.0 or better</li>
	<li>Access to a database (or the privileges to create one) on a MySQL or PostgreSQL server</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you want to use the <i>Image Verification</i> (CAPTCHA) feature in the registration of new users, you'll need to have the <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">GD Graphics Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.freetype.org">FreeType Library</a> installed and configured in your environment.</p>


<h2>Fresh Installation</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Upload the entire contents of the <span class="path">upload</span> directory to a location of your choice on your server.</li>
	<li>Begin the installation by accessing the <span class="path">setup</span> subdirectory via your Web browser.</li>
	<li>Select &quot;Fresh Installation&quot; as the type, simply follow the instructions, and post any problems you run into on the <a href="http://www.ovbb.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?forumid=3">OvBB Project Support Forum</a>.</li>
	<li><i>Be sure to delete the <span class="path">setup</span> subdirectory immediately after installation is completed.</i></li>
</ol>


<h2>Upgrade From V0.15a</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Upload the entire contents of the <span class="path">upload</span> directory to the location of your forums, overwriting files as necessary.</li>
	<li>Begin the upgrade by accessing the <span class="path">setup</span> subdirectory via your Web browser.</li>
	<li>Select &quot;Upgrade From V0.15a&quot; as the type, simply follow the instructions, and post any problems you run into on the <a href="http://www.ovbb.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?forumid=3">OvBB Project Support Forum</a>.</li>
	<li><i>Be sure to delete the <span class="path">setup</span> subdirectory immediately after the upgrade is completed.</i></li>
</ol>
